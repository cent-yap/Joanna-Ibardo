                            <h2>Childhood Years</h2>
                            <p>1. Here’s my childhood story. <sup>2</sup> I loved playing outside with my childhood friends. <sup>3</sup> We played Chinese garter, piko, tagu-taguan, and many other Filipino games. <sup>4</sup> It was always fun, and we never got tired of running around. <sup>5</sup> We laughed, shouted, and competed with each other every day. <sup>6</sup> No matter how hot or rainy it was, we always found a way to play. <sup>7</sup> I still remember when it was getting darker outside, it would be time to go home. <sup>8</sup> But I never wanted to stop playing. <sup>9</sup> Every evening, my lolo would come looking for me. <sup>10</sup> He would call me angrily, “Uwi na, Kababae mong tao, nasa labas ka pa!” <sup>11</sup> The moment I saw him, I would quickly run back home. <sup>12</sup> At that time, I felt mad whenever I was forced to stop playing. <sup>13</sup> I thought it was unfair that I had to go home while my friends could still play. <sup>14</sup> I would stomp my feet and pout, wishing I could stay outside longer. <sup>15</sup> But now that I am grown up, I understand why my lolo was so strict. <sup>16</sup> He was only protecting me and making sure I was safe. <sup>17</sup> Looking back, those childhood moments make me smile. <sup>18</sup> I miss the days when life was simple, and all I cared about was playing. <sup>19</sup> The friendships I made during those years were priceless. <sup>20</sup> Those memories will always stay with me.</p>

                            <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
                            <p>1. When I was in my teenage years, around 7th to 10th grade, my classmates and I would hang out together after school. <sup>2</sup> We would go to KTVs or the mall, just to play in the arcades, because we had free time to do whatever we wanted. <sup>3</sup> After playing, we would go out to eat and enjoy each other’s company. <sup>4</sup> Those were some of the best moments of my teenage years. <sup>5</sup> We had so much fun. <sup>6</sup> My teenage years were also filled with school competitions, such as dancing and role-playing. <sup>7</sup> I was very outgoing back then, never shy to join any activity. <sup>8</sup> I loved being involved in everything, whether it was dancing, acting, or just having fun with friends. <sup>9</sup> Now, I can’t imagine doing those things anymore. <sup>10</sup> My confidence during my teenage years was something I took for granted, but now I feel different. <sup>11</sup> I also joined the varsity badminton team in high school. <sup>12</sup> We competed in intramurals, playing against different schools. <sup>13</sup> I participated in both singles and doubles events. <sup>14</sup> Sometimes we won gold, sometimes silver, and those wins made me proud. <sup>15</sup> I worked hard with my teammates, and the experiences taught me a lot about teamwork. <sup>16</sup> Looking back, I miss the energy and excitement of those days. <sup>17</sup> I miss the competitions, the fun with friends, and the freedom to do whatever I wanted. <sup>18</sup> Now, I feel like I can’t do the same things I used to do. <sup>19</sup> My teenage years were full of unforgettable moments that I will always remember. <sup>20</sup> I learned a lot during those years, and they shaped the person I am today.</p>

                            <h2>College Years</h2>
                            <p>1. Now that I am in college, my first year was hard. <sup>2</sup> I had trouble adjusting to the new setup. <sup>3</sup> Sometimes I felt overwhelmed and wondered if I was doing things right. <sup>4</sup> I often questioned if I chose the right course. <sup>5</sup> There were times when I had breakdowns because of the pressure. <sup>6</sup> It was difficult at first, but it has become a bit easier. <sup>7</sup> I met some classmates who became my support system. <sup>8</sup> They helped me whenever I needed it. <sup>9</sup> I also learned how to manage my time better. <sup>10</sup> I now know how to balance schoolwork and free time. <sup>11</sup> College is different from high school, and I can’t do the same things I used to. <sup>12</sup> I also miss going to arcades with friends, but I still try. <sup>13</sup> I’ve learned how to organize my time so I don’t get too stressed. <sup>14</sup> I try to stay focused on my studies and make time for fun. <sup>15</sup> Being in college has taught me a lot. <sup>16</sup> It’s not easy, but I’m learning how to handle it. <sup>17</sup> I still sometimes feel pressure, but I know how to deal with it now. <sup>18</sup> I’ve grown a lot since I started college. <sup>19</sup> Even though it’s tough, I know I’m getting better at it. <sup>20</sup> My college years have been challenging, but I’m making it through.</p>
