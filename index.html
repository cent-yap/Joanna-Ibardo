    <summary class="content">Childhood</summary>
        <p>Here’ s my childhood story starts. I loved playing outside with my childhood
            friends. We played Chinese garter, piko, tagu-taguan, and many other Filipino
            games. It was always fun, and we never got tired of running around. We laughed,
            shouted, and competed with each other every day. No matter how hot or rainy it
            was, we always found a way to play. I still remember when its getting darker
            outside it would be time to go home. But I never wanted to stop playing. Every
            evening, my lolo would come looking for me. He would call me angrily, “Uwi na,
            Kababae mong tao, nasa labas ka pa!”. The moment I saw him, I would quickly
            run back home. At that time, I felt mad whenever I was forced to stop playing. I
            thought it was unfair that I had to go home while my friends could still play. I
            would stomp my feet and pout, wishing I could stay outside longer. But now that I
            am grown up, I understand why my lolo was so strict. He was only protecting me
            and making sure I was safe. Looking back, those childhood moments make me
            smile. I miss the days when life was simple, and all I cared about was playing. The
            friendships I made during those years were priceless. Those memories will always
            stay with me. Even though I didn’t realize it back then, my childhood was truly a
            happy one.

    <summary class="content">Teenager</summary>
        <p>When I was in my teenage years, around 7th to 10th grade, my classmates and I
            would hang out together after school. We would go to KTVs or the mall, just to
            play in the arcades, because we had free time to do whatever we wanted. After
            playing, we would go out to eat and enjoy each other’s company. Those were
            some of the best moments of my teenage years. We had so much fun, My teenage
            years were also filled with school competitions, such as dancing and role-playing. I
            was very outgoing back then, never shy to join any activity. I loved being involved
            in everything, whether it was dancing, acting, or just having fun with friends. Now,
            I can’t imagine doing those things anymore. My confidence during my teenage
            years was something I took for granted, but now I feel different. I also joined the
            varsity badminton team in high school. We competed in intramurals, playing
            against different schools. I participated in both singles and doubles events.
            Sometimes we won gold, sometimes silver, and those wins made me proud. I
            worked hard with my teammates, and the experiences taught me a lot about
            teamwork. Looking back, I miss the energy and excitement of those days. I miss
            the competitions, the fun with friends, and the freedom to do whatever I wanted.
            Now, I feel like I can’t do the same things I used to do. My teenage years were
            full of unforgettable moments that I will always remember. I learned a lot during
            those years, and they shaped the person I am today. Though I can’t go back to
            those times, I cherish those memories and the lessons I learned.

    <summary class="content">College</summary>
        <p>Now that I am in college, my first year was hard. I had trouble adjusting to the
            new setup. Sometimes I felt overwhelmed and wondered if I was doing things
            right. I often questioned if I chose the right course. There were times when I had
            breakdowns because of the pressure. It was difficult at first, but it has become a
            bit easier. I met some classmates who became my support system. They helped
            me whenever I needed it. I also learned how to manage my time better. I now
            know how to balance schoolwork and free time. College is different from high
            school, and I can’t do the same things I used to. I also miss going to arcadess
            with friends, but I still try. I’ve learned how to organize my time so I don’t get too
            stressed. I try to stay on focused on my studies and make time for fun. Being in
            college has taught me a lot. It’s not easy, but I’m learning how to handle it. I still
            sometimes feel pressure, but I know how to deal with it now. I’ve grown a lot
            since I started college. Even though it’ s tough, I know I’m getting better at it.
